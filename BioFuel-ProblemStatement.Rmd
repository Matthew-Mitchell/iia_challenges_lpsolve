# Problem Statement

A company that produces aircraft biofuel is planning a new product
called FC (Fuel-Corn). The table below shows the total quarterly demand in
tons (t) for the coming years as communicated by their customers.

FC demand (T)

| Q1             | Q2           | Q3           | Q4          |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |-----------: |
| 1,200    | 1,100    | 1,300   |  1,000 |

Fuel corn is made of a combination of Fuel and Corn. The supply schedule dictates that we purchase these raw materials on a bimonthly schedule. The costs per ton of Fuel and Corn for
every two month period in the coming year is listed below.

|           | B1        | B2      |    B3    | B4   |  B5  |  B6  |
| :-------- | :-------: | :------:| :------: | :---:|:----:| ----:|
|Fuel (\$/t) | 2         |2.5      |   2      |  1   |  1.5 |  3   |
|Corn (\$/t) | 1.5       | 1       |   2      |  1   |  2   |   2.5|


FC composition is obtained by mixing 35% of Fuel and 65% of Corn.
The life of Fuel is of four consecutive months and the life of Corn, six
(i.e., if we buy Fuel in early January, we cannot use it in early May).
We just buy Fuel and Corn at the beginning of each two-month period
and make the deliveries of FC at the beginning of each quarter. For
simplicity, we assume that one can buy, mix and sell the same day.
In addition, the plant manager has told us that in any two-month period, we cannot buy more Fuel than triple of Corn.

Develop a model to minimize the cost of production.
